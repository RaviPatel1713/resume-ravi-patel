% Project 1
%====================
\subsection{{FLY RIGHT  {\normalfont (C++, Python, pandas, CSV, Git, Slack)} \hfill Nov 2021}}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Utilized OpenFlights dataset, an open-source dataset containing 10000+ major airports and flight routes throughout the world
\item Processed the raw dataset using Python's CSV module and pandas library, as a result refining, mapping missing data entries, and cutting off unnecessary data-point information for this project
\item Constructed custom graph design for representing flight route network 
\item Functionalized the shortest path-finding feature using Dijkstra's Algorithm and most significant airport-determining feature using Betweenness-Centrality computation
\item Analyzed the dataset and concluded a strong correlation between airport significance and airport passenger traffic 
\end{zitemize}

% Project 2
%====================
\subsection{{IDEAL GAS SIMULATION {\normalfont (C++, Cinder Graphics, CLion, Git)} \hfill Nov 2020}}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Created a C++ based application using CLion integrated programming technology that can simulate, visualize, and analyze the behavior of particles in an ideal gas setting
\item Integrated Cinder graphics (from Cinder Blocks), an external C++ graphics library which renders the simulation behavior in a smooth and
powerful manner
\end{zitemize}

%====================
% Project 3
%====================
\subsection{{NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER {\normalfont (C++, Cinder Graphics, CLion, Git)} \hfill Oct 2020}}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Developed a C++ based application using CLion that allows 28 x 28 number image classification from trained model
\item Trained model for percent varying from 10\% to 20\% and analyzed accuracy of the model
\item Integrated Cinder (from Cinder Blocks), an external C++ graphics library which enabled
drawing and rendering 28 by 28 pixel image to be classified
\end{zitemize}
